# Music Visualiser Project

# Description of the assignment
For my assignment I created a music visualiser that would produce different shapes and visuals which would respond the music (the amplitude). My goal the assignment was to create something simple but effective. The simplistic design not only provides an colourful visual exerience but also lets you feel the song. The song I have chosen is one of my favourites to just get in the zone but higher mind frame. Both 2D and 3D shapes are used.
# Instructions

- Press the space key to start the music
- To pause the music press 'p'
- To resert the music press 's'
- Start the visuals press 1, 2, 3 , 4
- Press 5 for the info menu

This is code:

```Java
public void render()
{
	ui.noFill();
	ui.stroke(255);
	ui.rect(x, y, width, height);
	ui.textAlign(PApplet.CENTER, PApplet.CENTER);
	ui.text(text, x + width * 0.5f, y + height * 0.5f);
}
```

So is this without specifying the language:

```
public void render()
{
	ui.noFill();
	ui.stroke(255);
	ui.rect(x, y, width, height);
	ui.textAlign(PApplet.CENTER, PApplet.CENTER);
	ui.text(text, x + width * 0.5f, y + height * 0.5f);
}
```
